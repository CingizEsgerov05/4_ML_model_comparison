# Machine Learning Model Comparison (Breast Cancer Dataset)

This project compares four classical machine learning algorithms on the Breast Cancer dataset:
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to evaluate how different ML models perform on a binary classification problem and identify the most accurate algorithm.

## 📊 Models Evaluated
| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Naive Bayes | Probabilistic classifier using Bayes' theorem |
| Random Forest | Ensemble of decision trees |
| SVM | Max-margin classifier |
| Logistic Regression | Linear classifier for binary problems |

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- Bar chart comparison

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 🚀 Result
Random Forest and SVM typically achieve the highest accuracy on this dataset.
